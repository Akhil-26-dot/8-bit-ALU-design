# 8-bit-ALU-design
The project involves designing an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog. The ALU performs eight different operations based on a 3-bit opcode, making it a fundamental component in digital circuits and processors. The implementation includes both the ALU module and a testbench to verify its functionality.
